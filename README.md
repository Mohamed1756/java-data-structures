# **JAVA**
Includes **Data Structure Java Code** implementations such as; Arrays, Maps, LinkedList, Stacks, Queues,Lists and Hash Functions.

Notes- 

**Arrays:**

Fixed in size – best for data retrieval
Can be used in 2D arrays
Deleting elements is hard
    
    2d Arrays:
    (Rows, columns)
    To print 2D array in sout: deep.ToString

**List interface**
    
    Backed by an array
    Ordered collection – sequence
    Allows duplicates
    Not fixed in size like arrays
    Fast for data retrieve, i.e. deletion and insertion
    Includes ArrayList and stacks and vectors 	

**Stacks** – **L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut

    Push(add), pop(delete), peek(top)
    Can test if it is empty
    Can search stack 

**Queue** – **F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut
    
    A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing
    Head(beginning), tail(end)
    Printer is a good example – pages are queues  

**LinkedList**

    Collection of nodes – each node contains reference to next and previous nodes
    Head and tail positions – reference to null position (doubly-linked-list) as they have reference.
    Bi-directional linked list – element in one direction.
    Can insert any data type
    Expensive on memory due to reference information. 

**Sets**

    Collection that contains no duplicate elements – unique values only
    Doesn’t guarantee order
    TreeSet preserves order – backed by a tree
    Use HashSet if order not important. Not get index! As order is not guaranteed.
    Use override equals, string, hash code – if using tradition method. i.e., not records


**Map**
    
    Collection of key/value pairs
    HashTable(Nulls not allowed), HashMap(Nulls allowed), SortedMap.
    No duplicate keys – each key can map to at most one value.

**Hash** 

    The Hash function produces the map values into hash code – i.e., numbers 	
    Can Use the number to map back to the string
    Happens internally
